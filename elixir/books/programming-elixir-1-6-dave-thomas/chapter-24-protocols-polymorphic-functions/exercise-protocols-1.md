# Exercise: Protocols-1

A basic Caesar cypher consists of shifting the letters in a message by a fixed offset. For an offset of 1, for example, `a` will become `b`, `b` will become `c` and `z` will become `a`. If the offset is 13, we have the ROT13 algorithm.

Lists and binaries can be _stringlike_. Write a `Caesar` protocol that applies to both. It would include two functions: `encrypt(string, shift)` and `rot13(string)`.
