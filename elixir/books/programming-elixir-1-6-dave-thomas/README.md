### Programming Elixir 1.6 by Dave Thomas

I started reading this book around Feb 02 2020, but at the time could not focus on it and had to pause.

Got back to reading it around June 14 2020 and finished on July 12 2020.

#### Veredict

This book is amazing for anyone not familiar with Elixir, but with some programming experience. It goes from the most basic constructs, like how Elixir Lists works, to the most advanced ones like OTP Servers.

The author tries to not expatiate too much on Elixir / Erlang internals, but this is good, as this books seems to be more oriented to someone just starting to work with Elixir.
